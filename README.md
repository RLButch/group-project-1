Data source: Kaggle dataset, NY rental listings in 2019
Investigations:
* What portion of the rentals correspond to each room type?
* How are the rentals distributed across NY?
* What has the biggest correlation with price? 
*What are the most popular rental locations in NY?
* What are some key features of the popular rental areas (tourist attractions)?
* What is the correlation between suburb to rental
*How does days occupied related to price - or is it influenced by price?
*What/how is the price for rentals distributed?
* What is the average stay (length) by room type in rentals in NY? (summary statistics)
* Public transport - do the popular suburbs have good access to public transport (subway stations)?

Summaries:
The most popular room type is entire house/apartment
Price and days occupied are (negatively) weakly correlated
Price is an important factor when choosing a rental listing
Price distribution is focused around the $ 300â€“400 prices with few observations that present higher prices.
The production of a P value = 1 in the anova analysis suggests this data is not normally distributed and performing an anova analysis violates the assumption that the data is normally distributed.

Brooklyn has the most listings followed by Manhattan, indicating that these are the most sought-after and desirable suburbs for renters, likely due to their central location, amenities, and easy access to transportation.
the top 10 most popular suburbs for renters in New York City. Renters can use this information to understand which neighborhoods are high in demand and may require competitive bidding, while landlords can tailor their marketing efforts and prices accordingly based on the demand.
The scatter plot shows the negative correlation between the popularity of certain neighborhoods for rentals and the duration of occupancy. As a neighborhood becomes more popular and has a higher number of rentals, the average number of days rented decreases, indicating a preference for short-term stays.
