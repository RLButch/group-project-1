Group members: Trong Hieu Luu, Maria Florencia Martin and Rebecca Butcher
Data source: Kaggle dataset, NY rental listings in 2019
Investigations:
* What portion of the rentals correspond to each room type?
* How are the rentals distributed across NY?
* What has the biggest correlation with price? 
*What are the most popular rental locations in NY?
* What are some key features of the popular rental areas (tourist attractions)?
* What is the correlation between suburb to rental
*How does days occupied related to price - or is it influenced by price?
*What/how is the price for rentals distributed?
* What is the average stay (length) by room type in rentals in NY? (summary statistics)
* Public transport - do the popular suburbs have good access to public transport (subway stations)?

Summaries:
The most popular room type is entire house/apartment
Price and days occupied are (negatively) moderately correlated
Price is an important factor when choosing a rental listing
Price distribution is focused around the $ 300â€“400 prices with few observations that present higher prices.
The production of a P value = 1 in the anova analysis suggests this data is not normally distributed and performing an anova analysis violates the assumption that the data is normally distributed.
